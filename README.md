# Simple Blogging website

A simple blog website built using Python's Tkinter library, allowing users to **create**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** blog posts. The posts are stored in a text file, providing persistence so that posts are saved even after the application is closed.

## Features
- **Create Posts**: Allows users to create new blog posts with a title and content.
- **View Posts**: Displays a list of posts that users can view in detail.
- **Edit Posts**: Users can edit existing posts and save changes.
- **Delete Posts**: Users can delete posts permanently from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Posts are stored in a text file (`blog_posts.txt`) for persistence.
